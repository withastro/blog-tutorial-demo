  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!

  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
